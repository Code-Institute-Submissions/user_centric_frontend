# Anthony Aneke's Code Institute Milestone Project 1

## Introduction
The project milestone 1 is to employ user-centric front end development to create
a website. The milestone gives two options:

1. Select a project idea from a suggested list of projects
2. Create a website outside for a purpose outside of the suggested list of ideas

I have selected to develop a website not in the selected list of ideas.

## Purpose
This website is a full-service intellectual property law company with the competence in patents, litigation, and design.

## UX design
Leveraged CSS bootstrap for mobile first user experience.

## Suitability for purpose
It is my believe this website contains all information in regards to companies mandate 

##	Navigation
It is my believe this website contains apposite navigation for users

## Ease of use
It is my believe this website provides ease of use for its customers.

## Information Architecture
It is my believe this website meets the standard structural and behavioral design criteria 

## Layout and Visual Impact:
Responsive Design – I tested the site response in multiple simulated devices (tablets and mobile) and the website responded by adjusting its layout to the simulated screen sizes.
Image Presentation
Colour scheme and typography
## Software Development practices:
Directory Structure and File Naming – I went through systematic approach to develop a naming convention. After establishing this, I created html files for each website page as well as naming the  pages to correspond to the top menu bar drop down. 

## Version control
Git was used for version control. I incrementally and iteratively staged, committed, and pushed new or modified all changes during the implementation of the website

## Testing implementation
I set up a test environment (Light-weight http server) that served the webpages to be tested. I did static testing and visual inspection to make sure content was rendered as designed, I executed system testing to make sure use cases worked in accordance to design intent.  

## Testing write-up
I tested all the links to make sure there was no broken links.
Visual inspection was executed for typos and a proper display of html elements. 
System Test was executing to make sure dropdown pages were rendered in accordance to design intent. 

## Readme file
Confirmed

## Deployment implementation
I utilized Git hub pages service to make website available. 

## Deployment write-up
I copied my private repo (user_centric_frontend) into the akshaynorth.github.io public repo, resulting in making the ipattache website available through the Git hub pages

## Code Template Credits
For the development of this milestone project 1 a website template was employed. 
The template contains a set of HTML, CSS (Bootstrap4), JavaScript files that can be
altered as needed. The code was downloaded from the following website::

    https://themewagon.com/

The site contains a collection of  free and paid templates. For this assignent, I
choosed the *Legal Care* webiste template. The chosen website template can be found
